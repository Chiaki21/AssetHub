## 🚀 Quick Start (For Non-Technical Users)

I've designed AssetHub to be as easy to start as possible. No SQL Server installation is required on your machine.

### Prerequisites
1.  **Docker Desktop:** [Download and install here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). (Ensure it is running before launching the app).
2.  **.NET 8 Runtime:** Usually included with Windows, but can be [found here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

### Installation
1.  Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/Chiaki21/AssetHub/releases/tag/AssetHub)** page of this repository.
2.  Download the `AssetHub.zip` file.
3.  **Extract** the ZIP folder to your desktop.
4.  Double-click **`Run_AssetHub.bat`**.
5.  Run the AssetHub.exe
6.  Register and account and use it for login, it will take you to dashboard, or you can use the test credentials Email: testuser@assethub.com Password: testuser@123

> **Note:** On the first run, the app may take a few seconds to start while Docker pulls the SQL Server image and builds the database tables.
